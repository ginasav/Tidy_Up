<h1>Tidy Up - Get rid of the annoying space!</h1>

This is my first solo project.

The app idea is simple: using the measure feature of the iPhone, you measure the shelf of your library and it tells you how many books can fit in it!

I'm exploring ARKit, RealityKit and some Animation for the splash screen.

## Features:
- You can add a book to your library, delete it or edit it
- You can measure the shelf with the Tidy Up View
- The app tells you how many and which of the books you inserted, can fit in the shelf

  **Supports VoiceOver**

The UI is simple, but in the future I could work on it.

Some future implementations would be:
- 3d-animation of the books that fit in the shelf
- filtering of the books based on author, year of publication, genre, etc.
- implementation of some API to call a public database of books
- alghoritm that takes into consideration some books you *really* want on to that shelf.
